## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to refactor a badly designed code with **template method design pattern** during the **Clean Coding Dojo** event (check About section for the article URL on **Medium.com**).

To achieve this within a relatively short time, the focus was on keeping things as simple as possible. You won't find any fancy solutions or exotic technologies here â€” just plain and simple **C#**. Don't let this take your joy away, we have discussed complex doubts and answered fascinating questions with the participants of the event along the way.

This repository was private since July 2021, but now I've decided to make it public and refactor the codebase a little bit.
